## Problem statement(general) 

The impact of Covid-19 on various industries around the world is extremely huge. Countless people and companies have suffered huge losses due to inadequate preparation in the face of this challenge. Now, as the epidemic situation becomes clearer, one can't help but reflect: "If another 'global event' occurs - whether medical, financial, energy, environmental or otherwise - how do we continue to operate effectively and how can we better prepare? " We believe there are certain potential harbingers of such events, so we want to explore identifying the precursors of "long-term public outrage" and the possible impacts and outcomes. 

## Scenario(specific ) 

The Covid-19 epidemic situation can be seen as a good example. Before the epidemic spread to the UK, several indicators can be traced: a) a potentially life-threatening virus, b) public concern, fear, and desire to act, and c) a traceable geographic transmission pathway with the same key characteristics that eventually evolved into a "long-term public outrage" 

## Solution  

We decided to build a public opinion detection system to help our customers to detect the very first sign of public outrage based on several risk indicators i.e. suddenly increasing attention to the company, negative comments and a sudden volatity in its stock price, etc.. Then we send early warnings that could lead to early intervention and minimize the expected loss amount. We also provide a simulation about the best, median and worst possible results to help our clients decide the right timing and way to solve the public outrage in the most effective way. 

In this system, we will also utilize Natural Language Processing methods to conduct sentiment analysis on social media data including but not limited to Twitter, Reddit and Google to get both qualitative and quantitative measurement of the public opinions towards the event or the company.
